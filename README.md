Things to OPML.applescript
========================

An AppleScript to export Things database to OPML.

Notes
-----

* Tested with Things 2.2.5 on OS X Mavericks 10.9.1.
* The code is messy, but it somewhat works for me.

TODOs
------

1. Get Repeating ToDos (currently no way via AppleScript).
2. Find nice way to export Tags.
3. Find nice way to export Due Dates.
4. Find nice way to export Areas.
5. Create a way to only export a selected Project.
